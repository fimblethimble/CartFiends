# Project Info
The work completed in this project is intended for use by the team members only. 
We hold no liability for users implementing this material.

This repository holds code and supporting documents for a semi-autonomout shopping cart.
The design goals are to build a cart that can follow a user under its own propulsion.
While navigating a store, the cart must avoid collisions with objects and shoppers.
